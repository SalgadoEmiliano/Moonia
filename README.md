## ⚙️ How It Works

Moonia combines technical indicators, AI commentary, and your personal preferences (like risk tolerance and growth goal) to generate trade guidance in seconds.

| Market Behavior        | Signal         |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Momentum Weakens       | 🔻 SELL         |
| Momentum Strengthens   | 🚀 BUY          |
| Trend Is Unclear       | 🤝 HOLD         |

It calculates:
- Price averages (20-day, 50-day)
- Volatility (ATR)
- Trend momentum and volume
- Position sizing based on your risk limit

All of this is interpreted through **Moonia AI**, which generates smart, human-readable insights.
