## ⚙️ How It Works

Moonia computes technical indicators, generates **AI commentary**, and personalizes the strategy based on your risk tolerance and goal:

| Market Behavior         | Signal |
|-------------------------|--------|
| Momentum Weakens        | 🔻 SELL   |
| Momentum Strengthens    | 🚀 BUY    |
| Trend is Unclear        | ⚪ HOLD    |

It calculates:

- Moving averages (20-day, 50-day)
- Volatility (ATR)
- Trend momentum and volume
- Position sizing based on your risk % and equity

Everything is interpreted through **Moonia AI**, which delivers smart, human-readable explanations — not generic text.
